# Overview of Simulation Code
This file includes the simulation codes used for the simulation of floods. The core for the simulation is `ANUGA Hydro`(https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/anuga_core) which is a solver for Shallow Water Equation(SWE). Because `ANUGA Hydro` is not developed based on Python 3.6, codes for simulation are written in Python 2.7 environment. 

The simulation is based on the real topology of Austin, Texas. The GIS data, necessary polygons are saved in `GISdata&mesh`. `aw_small_project.py` defines the parameters used for simulation. `aw_small_river.csv` saves the information of polygon that contains the river in studied domain. `aw_small.msh` is the file that includes the mesh information(irregular triangle mesh). `aw_simu.ipynb` is the code that can be run for simulation.
